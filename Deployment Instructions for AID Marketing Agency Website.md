## Deployment Instructions for AID Marketing Agency Website

I have successfully optimized your images and updated the `index.html` file in your local repository to reflect these changes. To get these updates live on your website, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Review the Changes Locally (Optional but Recommended)

Before pushing to GitHub, you can review the changes I've made to ensure everything looks as expected. You can do this by opening the `index.html` file located in the `landingpages` directory on your local machine in a web browser.

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes to Your GitHub Repository

1.  **Navigate to your local repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `landingpages` directory where your website files are located.

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/landingpages
    ```

    (Replace `path/to/your/landingpages` with the actual path to your cloned repository on your computer.)

2.  **Add all changed files:** This command stages all modified and new files for commit.

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Commit the changes:** This saves your changes to your local repository with a descriptive message.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Optimize images and update image paths"
    ```

4.  **Push changes to GitHub:** This uploads your committed changes from your local repository to your remote GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    (Assuming your main branch is named `main`. If it's `master`, use `git push origin master` instead.)

### Step 3: Netlify Automatic Deployment

Since your website is hosted on Netlify and connected to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically detect the new commits to your `main` (or `master`) branch. It will then:

1.  **Trigger a new build:** Netlify will start a new build process for your site.
2.  **Deploy the updated site:** Once the build is successful, Netlify will deploy the new version of your website with the optimized images.

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After a few minutes, visit your website `aidmarketingagency.com` to confirm that the new images are displayed correctly and the website loads efficiently.
