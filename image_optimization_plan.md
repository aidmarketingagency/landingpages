## Image Optimization Plan

Based on the `index.html` file, the following images are referenced:

1.  **About Section Image:** `about-image.jpg`
    *   **Current Usage:** Appears to be a larger hero or section image.
    *   **Optimization Goal:** Balance visual quality with fast loading. Consider a responsive image approach if the design requires different sizes for various screen widths. For now, I will aim for a reasonable desktop display size.

2.  **Testimonial Author Avatars:** `jeremy-funderburk.jpg`, `bob-gors.jpg`, `gina-davila.jpg`
    *   **Current Usage:** Small circular or square avatars next to testimonials.
    *   **Optimization Goal:** Small file size, square dimensions, and potentially a WebP format for better compression.

**General Optimization Strategy:**
*   **Format:** Convert all images to WebP for better compression and quality, with JPEG fallbacks for older browsers if necessary (though Netlify often handles this with its image optimization features).
*   **Dimensions:** Resize images to appropriate dimensions based on their usage in the layout.
*   **Compression:** Apply optimal compression settings to reduce file size without significant quality loss.

**Specific Image Mapping (from provided images to HTML placeholders):**

*   `about-image.jpg`: I will need to select one of the provided full-body or wider shots for this. `headshot_1457.jpg` or `headshot_1463.jpg` seem suitable.
*   `jeremy-funderburk.jpg`, `bob-gors.jpg`, `gina-davila.jpg`: I will use the provided headshots for these. I have multiple headshots, so I will pick three distinct ones.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Select specific images for each placeholder.
2.  Determine target dimensions for each image based on common web design practices for similar elements.
3.  Write a Python script to perform resizing and format conversion.
4.  Update `index.html` to reference the new image paths and potentially add responsive image elements if needed.
